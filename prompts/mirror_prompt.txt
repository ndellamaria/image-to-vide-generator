A serene lakeside scene captured in a rearview mirror reflects two individuals enjoying a tranquil boat ride. Add a gentle ripple effect to the water in the background, capturing subtle motion. Maintain the photo's warm film grain and soft color temperature. Keep the composition with the sun-glare intact, ensuring the reflection remains static. Set a frame rate of 24fps and loop duration of 5 seconds for a seamless visual experience.
