Generate a cinemagraph of a serene mountain landscape at sunrise with a gentle, flowing cascade of clouds over the peaks. Maintain a frame rate of 24fps. Add movement to the clouds, creating a soft drifting effect while keeping the mountains static. Preserve the film grain and the cool color temperature. Ensure the sun rays subtly shift, casting dynamic light across the scene. Loop duration should be 5 seconds, focusing on capturing the tranquil and timeless essence of nature.
