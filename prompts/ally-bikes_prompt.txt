Generate a 5-second loop at 24fps capturing a gentle breeze causing the leaves in the trees to sway slightly. Add soft movement to the clouds, creating a slow drift across the sky. Maintain the film's grainy texture and warm color tones, with static elements like the graffiti and bicycles remaining untouched. Keep the composition focused on the building facade, ensuring the motion is subtle to preserve the photo's original rustic charm.
