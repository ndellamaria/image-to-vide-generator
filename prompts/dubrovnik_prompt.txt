Create a 5-second loop cinemagraph from this tranquil coastal landscape. Include gentle ripple motions in the sea, while keeping the buildings and hills static. Preserve the film aesthetic with warm color temperature and natural film grain. Use a frame rate of 24fps and ensure imperceptible transitions to maintain the loop's seamless flow. The sky should have subtle cloud movements, adding a dynamic yet calming effect to the composition.
