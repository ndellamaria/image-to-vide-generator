Create a 5-second looping cinemagraph at 24fps of a natural rock arch framing a tranquil seaside pool. Add a subtle motion to the waterâ€™s surface, creating gentle ripples reflecting the sunlight. Keep the rocks and arch static to preserve their texture. Apply a warm color temperature with noticeable film grain, enhancing the nostalgic film aesthetic. Ensure the motion is smooth and calming, complementing the serene coastal atmosphere.
