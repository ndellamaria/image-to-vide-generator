Create a serene 5-second loop at 24fps, highlighting the gentle ripples on the water's surface while preserving the silhouette of the castle and church tower against the glowing sunset. Introduce a soft motion to the clouds, allowing them to drift slowly across the sky. Maintain the film grain and warm color temperature, accentuating the contrast between the dark foliage and glowing horizon. Keep the light flare effect static to enhance the timeless, tranquil ambiance.
