Create a 5-second looped video at 24fps, featuring subtle motion for the ocean waves gently lapping in the background. Keep the group of people and yoga mats static to preserve focus and balance. Apply film grain and maintain the cool, soft color temperature of the overcast day. Ensure the composition features the open space of the sky and sea to evoke a serene, peaceful moment, with the movement of the water enhancing the meditative atmosphere.
