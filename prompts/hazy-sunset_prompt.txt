Create a 5-second loop at 24fps, emphasizing the film grain and warm color temperature. Add subtle motion to the clouds, gently drifting across the mountainous horizon, while keeping the rocks and bench static. Preserve the film's composition and grain, allowing the soft glow of the sunrise to remain constant. Ensure the movement is natural and seamless, reflecting a serene, timeless moment in the mountains.
