Create a 5-second looped cinemagraph of a mountain lodge, preserving the film aesthetic with a warm color temperature and grainy texture. Set at 24fps, animate gentle movement in the clouds, creating a slow drift across the sky. Keep the lodge and foreground static to highlight the serene environment. Ensure the composition maintains the rugged mountain backdrop for a peaceful, timeless effect.
