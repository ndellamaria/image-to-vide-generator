Create a 5-second seamless loop at 24fps where the sunlight subtly flickers, creating a gentle lens flare effect over the mountainside. Add a soft breeze gently moving the grass and trees on the slope. Preserve the film grain and cool color temperature, ensuring the image retains its original film photography feel. Keep the composition focused on the mountainside, emphasizing its serene and natural beauty.
