Create a 5-second looping cinemagraph set at 24fps. Capture the serene essence of a sunlit beach scene with gentle waves softly rolling onto the shore. Include a slight shimmering of water and subtle movement of people in the distance. Keep beach umbrellas and seated figures static. Preserve the warm, golden film grain and soft highlights, emphasizing the relaxed atmosphere of a summer afternoon.
