Generate a 5-second loop at 24fps capturing a gentle breeze subtly swaying the tops of the trees in this film-style mountain landscape. Keep the sky and mountains static to preserve their grandeur. Apply a slight film grain and maintain the warm color temperature. Ensure the composition remains central with a focus on the mountain peak, allowing for a natural oscillation in the trees to create a calming, serene effect.
