Create a 5-second loop at 24fps depicting a beach scene. Capture gentle water trickles from a bottle, with light shimmering on droplets for added motion. Keep the dog and person static to enhance the serene moment. Preserve the film grain and warm color temperature to maintain the nostalgic beach ambiance. Subtle movements in the background, like swaying umbrellas or distant waves, add depth without overpowering the main focus.
