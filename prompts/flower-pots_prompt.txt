A film-style cinemagraph of terracotta flower pots in soft focus, with delicate motion in the gentle sway of flowers and subtle dappled sunlight shifting slightly across the pots. Maintain a 24fps frame rate, enhance with warm film grain and balanced color temperature. Keep the background softly blurred, emphasizing depth of field. The loop should be smooth and continuous, lasting 5 seconds, capturing the serene ambiance of a sunlit street scene.
