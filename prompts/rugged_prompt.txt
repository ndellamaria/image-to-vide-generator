Create a cinemagraph with a 5-second loop at 24fps, capturing the majestic mountain landscape under a dynamic sky. Introduce gentle motion in the clouds, flowing slowly across the peaks while keeping the mountains static. Preserve the film aesthetic with natural grain and a slightly cool color temperature. Emphasize the grandeur of the landscape by keeping the composition wide, allowing the subtle cloud movement to enhance the serene mountain view.
