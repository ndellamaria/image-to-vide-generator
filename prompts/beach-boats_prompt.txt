24fps. Capture the serene beach scene with blue boats as the central focus. Add gentle, looping motion to the waves lapping at the shore and the laundry slightly swaying in the breeze. Maintain the filmâ€™s warm grain and soft color temperature while highlighting the vibrant blue of the boats. Ensure the composition retains the original balance, focusing on the boats foreground and hillside buildings background. Loop duration: 5 seconds.
