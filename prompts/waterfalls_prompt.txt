Create a 5-second loop at 24fps, capturing a gentle ripple effect on the water in the foreground with subtle mist rising near the waterfalls. Keep the lush greenery and rocks static to preserve the film's nostalgic feel. Maintain film grain and a warm color temperature, enhancing the sunlight filtering through the foliage. Ensure seamless looping with gentle motion, emphasizing tranquility and timelessness in the composition.
