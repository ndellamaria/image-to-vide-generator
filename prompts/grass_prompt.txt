Create a 5-second looping cinemagraph at 24fps with the tall grasses swaying gently in a soft breeze. Maintain the film grain and muted green and brown color palette. The background trees remain static to emphasize the motion in the foreground. Ensure the composition retains the central focus on the tall grasses, with subtle movement to evoke a peaceful, natural atmosphere.
