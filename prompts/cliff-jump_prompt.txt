Create a 5-second loop at 24fps capturing the gentle motion of the sea, with subtle waves rippling naturally. Keep the jumper in mid-air static, preserving the film’s warm color temperature and soft grain texture. Include the sun’s reflection dancing on the water to add a serene, dynamic element, while maintaining the cliff rock's textures and the background's tranquility.
