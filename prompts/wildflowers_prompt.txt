Generate a 5-second looping cinemagraph of a serene mountain meadow with flowers gently swaying in the breeze. Use a frame rate of 24fps to capture the subtle motion of petals and grass, while keeping the distant mountains and sky static. Preserve the soft film grain and the cool color temperature, enhancing the bright, natural light. Ensure the composition focuses on the gentle movement, maintaining the peaceful ambiance of the original film aesthetic.
