Create a cinemagraph with a gentle sea breeze softly swaying the palm fronds and the loose fabric on the beach chairs while maintaining the static elements such as the surf shop and surrounding buildings. Preserve the film aesthetic with visible grain and a warm color temperature. Set the frame rate to 24fps, focusing on the natural movements with a 5-second loop, ensuring the composition remains balanced with a laid-back, coastal vibe.
