Create a 5-second loop at 24fps capturing a subtle breeze gently moving the climbers' clothing and ropes. Keep the mountain background and figures static to emphasize the film grain and natural color temperature. Focus on the movement of ropes and straps, preserving the composition's authentic ruggedness and camaraderie. Ensure the film's texture and mood are maintained throughout.
