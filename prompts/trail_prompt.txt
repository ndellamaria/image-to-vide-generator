Generate a 5-second looping cinemagraph at 24fps featuring this mountain landscape. Add gentle movement of the tree shadows swaying as if in a light breeze, while preserving the static beauty of the snow-capped mountains and clear sky. Maintain the film aesthetic with slight grain and cool color temperature. Ensure the composition emphasizes the sloping ridges and expansive view, creating a serene and timeless scene.
