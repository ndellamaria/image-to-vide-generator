Create a 5-second loop at 24fps, capturing the movement of the poi spinning gently in the air, casting shadows on the sand. Maintain the static elements, such as the beachgoers and umbrellas, to preserve the film's casual beach vibe. Include subtle film grain and warm color temperature to enhance the nostalgic feel. Ensure the composition focuses on the dancer's rhythmic motion while retaining the relaxed beach setting.
