Create a gentle cinemagraph of a tranquil marina at sunset with sailboats docked. At 24fps, add a subtle ripple to the water's surface, reflecting the evening light, while the boats and masts remain still. Preserve the film's natural grain and warm color temperature. Ensure the sky transitions smoothly from deep blue to soft peach, capturing the serene ambiance. The video should loop seamlessly over a duration of 5 seconds.
