Create a 24fps looped cinemagraph capturing the gentle motion of waves beneath the weathered concrete structure. Maintain the film aesthetic with subtle grain and warm color temperature. Allow the water below to move naturally, creating soft ripples and reflections, while keeping the concrete static. Ensure the composition preserves the details of the structure, balancing motion against stillness in a 5-second seamless loop.
