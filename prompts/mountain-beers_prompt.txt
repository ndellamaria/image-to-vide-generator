Create a 5-second looping cinemagraph with a 24fps frame rate. Maintain the film's grain and warm color temperature. Add subtle motion to the clouds in the background, gently shifting to evoke a sense of high-altitude breeze. Keep the climbers and structure static to preserve the compositionâ€™s focus. Ensure the motion is smooth and seamless, emphasizing the tranquility of the scene against the dramatic sky.
